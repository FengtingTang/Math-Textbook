# Math-Textbook



## What's This

This is a mathematics textbook rearrangement project. Based on the 2012 edition of "Compulsory Education Textbook Mathematics" published by the People's Education Press, it selects key knowledge and uses $LaTeX$ to rearrange it in the same way as the original textbook, aiming to help students review more purposefully.

## How to Replicate

You need any $LaTeX$ editor, use the XeLaTeX compiler, copy the main.tex file to the code area, and compile it to get a PDF file that is consistent with main.pdf.
